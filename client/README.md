# Description

We used ReactJS and Tailwind CSS to make the front end of the application while also using the axios library for easy CRUD processes. Multiple routes were also made to navigate between pages.

We had the full implementation of the Student API, but there was only time to integrate 70% of the student api into the front end. Considering that this was a team effort of 3 members who have never done web development before, we have made what we could in the time given.
